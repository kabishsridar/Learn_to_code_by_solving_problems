SAMPLE INPUT:
enter the secret encoded sentence: ipi lipikepe yopoupu

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
decoded sentence:  i like you

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. get the secret encoded sentence from the user and store as secret
2. assign the vowels both in small and capital letters by naming the variable as vowels
3. assign i as 0 and decoded as empty string
4. use while loop untill the i is lesser than the length of secret 
5. add current character to decoded
6. if current character is a vowel then it should skip next two characters so i = i+ 3
7. else it should be the consonant then it should move only one index as i = i + 1
8. print the decode sentence
