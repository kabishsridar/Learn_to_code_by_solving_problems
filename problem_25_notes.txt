SAMPLE INPUT:
Enter the length of ribbon and number of paint strokes (separated by a space between 1 and 100000): 10 3
Enter starting and ending position of painting stroke separated by a space: 2 5
Enter starting and ending position of painting stroke separated by a space: 3 7
Enter starting and ending position of painting stroke separated by a space: 8 10

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
3 7

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. get the input from the user for length of ribbon and number of paint strokes
2. split them and store as list named ns
3. Convert and store the first value as n (ribbon length).
4. Convert and store the second value as stroke (number of paint strokes).
5. Initialize ribbon and create a list ribbon with n elements, all set to 0 (representing purple).
6. loop through Each Paint Stroke**  
7. Read the user input for the start and end positions of the stroke.
8. Convert these positions into integers.
9. Iterate through the range from start to end position (as mentioned, not including ending position) and update the ribbon color to 1 (blue).
10. Count the number of 0s in ribbon (purple sections).
11. Count the number of 1s in ribbon (blue sections).
12. Display the Output Print the counts of purple and blue sections.
