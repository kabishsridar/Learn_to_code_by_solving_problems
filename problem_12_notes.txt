SCHOOL TRIP PROGRAMME
SAMPLE INPUTS:
Trip cost($) between 50 and 50000: 2500
Total number of students (4 to 2000): 4
Proportion of students per year (e.g. 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25): 0.25 0.20 0.50 0.05

SAMPLE OUTPUTS:
YES - More funds needed.

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. assign cost as a list with 12, 10, 7, 5 indicating 1st year student = $12 and seond year as $10 and so on
2. use for loop for 10 trips
3. get the input from user for trip cost and store as tcost in integer form
4. get the input from user for number of students as num_studets in integer form
5. get the input from user for proportion of students per year as proportion_input and split it 
6. use for loop and loop through the length of proportion which means number of students (0.4 0.2 0.3 0.1) convert those to float format
7. make students_per_year as empty list
8. loop through length of proportion_input and convert the number of students * proportion to integer and append them to students_per_year
9. loop through length of students_per_year and multiply students by cost per year and store it as total_raised
10. check if at least half of the cost of trip is covered
11. if covered print yes otherwise print no.
