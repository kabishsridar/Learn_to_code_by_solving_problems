VILLAGE NEIGHBOURHOOD PROGRAMME
SAMPLE INPUT:
Enter the number of villages (between 3 to 100): 4
Position of village 1: -100
Position of village 2: -50
Position of village 3: 20
Position of village 4: 0

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
 The smallest neighborhood size is: 35.0

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. get the input for number of villages and store it as n
2. if n is lesser than 3 print You need at least 3 villages to calculate neighborhoods. and it should exit from the programme
3. collect village positions one by one and store them in a list
4. sort the village positions
5. calculate neighborhood sizes by iteratig over middle villages (excluding first and last vilages)
6. Compute the neighborhood size as: size = (next - previous) / 2
7. If the computed size is smaller than min_size, update min_size.
8. print the smallest neighbourhood
