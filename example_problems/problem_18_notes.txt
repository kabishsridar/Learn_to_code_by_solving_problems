5. initiate cleaned_before_at as empty string
6. use while loop untill i is less than length of before_at if the nth character of before_at is not a '.' then then character should be added to cleaned_before_at
7. add i +1 to move to next character
8. assign cleaned_before_at + after_at as cleaned and return cleaned in this function
