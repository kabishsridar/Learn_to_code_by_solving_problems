STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. get input from the user for each three point shots, two point shots, one point shots scored by apples and bananas one by one in integer format and store it
2. make total score of both seperately as three point shots should be multiplied by three, two point shots with 2 and one point shot is left simple as anything multiplied by one is one
3. check the condition as if bananas total is greater than apples total the output should be bananas won
4. check the same if apples total is greater than bananas total then the output should be as apples won
5. if something else than these two condition it should print tie
