SAMPLE INPUT:
Enter the number of boxes (1 to 100): 4
Enter heights(in by leaving a space between the boxes): 1 2 5 4
Enter heights(in by leaving a space between the boxes): 2 5 9 4
Enter heights(in by leaving a space between the boxes): 2 5 9 6
Enter heights(in by leaving a space between the boxes): 1 5 9 3

SAMPLE OUTPUT:
NO

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. get input from user for number of boxes (1 to 100)
2. Store the input in a variable and validate that it is within the acceptable range  
3. Create an empty list called boxes to store the heights of action figures in each box  
4. Use a loop to iterate through each box and collect the heights from user input  
5. Prompt the user to enter a line that starts with the number of action figures followed by their heights  
6. Convert the user input into a list and remove the first value, keeping only the heights  
7. Convert the heights from text to numbers and store them in the list of boxes  
8. Define a function to check if the heights in each box are arranged in non-decreasing order  
9. If any box does not follow the non-decreasing order, display the message no and stop execution  
10. Extract the first and last heights of each box and store them in a separate list  
11. Sort the list of first and last heights to prepare for the final condition check  
12. Define a function to verify whether the first heights follow an increasing order condition  
13. Iterate through the sorted list to check if the starting height of each box is greater than or equal to the maximum height of the previous box  
14. If the heights meet both conditions, display the message yes to indicate the boxes can be organized  
15. If the heights fail the condition, display the message no to indicate the arrangement is not possible  
16. Ensure that the steps and conditions are implemented in an efficient manner to handle large inputs properly  
17. Use separate functions for different checks to keep the code modular and easy to update  
18. Test the code with different inputs to confirm accuracy before finalizing
