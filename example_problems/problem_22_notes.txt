SAMPLE OUTPUT:
1953

STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. Open the file skidesignin.txt in read mode and skidesignout.txt in write mode
2. read first line for number of heights and store as n 
3. read next n lies and convert into integer adn append to the list
4. loop through possible height ranges from to 83 and set hish as low + 17
5. iterate through the heights, if h is beyond the range, modify it as cost += (low - h) ** 2 if h < low and cost += (h - high) ** 2 if h > high
6. Update the minimum cost if the newly calculated cost is lower.
7. Write the minimum cost to the output file
