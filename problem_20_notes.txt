STEPS TO WRITE THE CODE:
1. open the file citystatein.txt in read mode and citystateout.txt in write mode
2. initiate pair_counts as empty dictionary
2. read the first line which is the number of cities and store it as n in integer format
3. use for loop and loop through each city using n and split city and state, then get first two characters of city, then store the second item in first line as state
4. check for the condition if first two characters of city is not equal to state then set pair_counts[key] as 1
5. else add 1 to pair_counts
6. initiate total as 0
7. use for loop and loop through all the keys in dictionary and generate the reverse_key byswapping city and state abbreviation
8. if the reverse_key in the dictionary pair_counts add pair_counts[key] * pair_counts[reverse_key] to total
9. as the loop will count twice we use total //2 and get unique pairs and add a new line and convert it to string
9. write the final computed result to citystateout.txt
