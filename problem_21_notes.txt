2. read the first line to get number of lifeguards, and next line to get the start and end times of each lifeguards shift
3. define a function num_covered(interval, fired) and use a set to store all unique time covered by the remaining lifeguards except fired.
4. loop through all intervals and return the length of set (covered time duration)
5. fire each lifeguards one by one and loop throuh index from 0 to n-1, using num_covered function fire each lifeguards temporarily and find the maximum time covered
6. write the maximum covered found to the file lifeguardsout.txt
